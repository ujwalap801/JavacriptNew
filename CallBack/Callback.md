### A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of some operation. This allows JavaScript functions to be asynchronous or behave differently based on the context. A common use case for callbacks is in asynchronous programming, like fetching data from a server. Instead of blocking the execution, JavaScript continues running other code, and once the data is retrieved, the callback is invoked to handle the result.


## 1. Function that is passed on as argument to another function is called callback function.

## 2. setTimeout helps turn JS which is singlethreaded and synchronous into asynchronous.
## 3. Event listeners can also invoke closures with scope.
## 4. Event listeners consume a lot of memory which can potentially slow down the website therefore it is good practice to remove if it is not used.
