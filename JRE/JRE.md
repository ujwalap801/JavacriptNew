##  JS Engine is Not a Machine
#  A JavaScript engine is a program or interpreter that executes JavaScript code. It converts JavaScript into machine code that the computer can understand and execute. Different engines may use different approaches to optimize the performance of JavaScript code.

## JavaScript (JS) is generally considered an interpreted language, but it's more accurate to describe it as both interpreted and compiled, depending on how it's executed.


# A JavaScript Runtime Environment is a software environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed. It includes everything needed to run JavaScript applications, from the JavaScript engine to the libraries and APIs that provide functionality. 

# A JavaScript runtime environment is essential for executing JavaScript code, whether in the browser or on the server. It encompasses the JavaScript engine, event loop, and APIs that allow developers to build dynamic web applications and server-side applications efficiently

# Interpreted: 
Traditional JavaScript engines, such as those in early web browsers, executed JavaScript code by interpreting it line-by-line. This means the source code was executed directly without being compiled into machine code first.

# Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: 
Modern JavaScript engines (like Google's V8 engine used in Chrome and Node.js) employ JIT compilation, where JavaScript is compiled into machine code at runtime. This allows for faster execution than pure interpretation because it optimizes performance dynamically.

## In summary, JavaScript is typically considered an interpreted language, but modern engines use JIT compilation to optimize performance, making it a hybrid of both approaches.


# JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation is a technique used by modern JavaScript engines to improve the performance of interpreted languages. In JIT compilation, the source code is compiled into machine code at runtime, just before it’s executed, rather than before execution like in traditional compiled languages (e.g., C++).

## How JIT Works:
Interpretation Phase: Initially, the code is interpreted line-by-line, allowing the program to start running quickly.
Hot Code Detection: The engine monitors the code that is frequently executed (known as "hot" code).

# Compilation: When hot code is detected, the JIT compiler compiles that portion of the code into optimized machine code.
Execution: The compiled machine code is then executed directly, which is much faster than interpreting the code repeatedly.

# Advantages of JIT:
# Faster Execution: 
 compiled, the code runs at nearly native speed since it's in machine code.

# Optimized for Real Usage: JIT compilers can optimize the code based on actual runtime data, improving performance by adapting to real execution patterns.

# Examples of JIT Engines:
Google V8: Used in Chrome and Node.js.
SpiderMonkey: Mozilla’s JavaScript engine used in Firefox.
Java's JVM: Java also uses JIT compilation for executing bytecode.
JIT combines the fast startup of interpretation with the high performance of compilation.
