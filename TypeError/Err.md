## Syntax Error
In your example:

let a = 10;
let a = 10; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared

# Explanation:
This code results in a Syntax Error because you are trying to declare the variable a twice using the let keyword in the same scope. The variable a has already been declared, so trying to declare it again results in a syntax error.

# Correction:
You should declare the variable only once or use a different variable name:

let a = 10; // Correctly declares 'a'


## Type Error

In your example:
const b; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

# Explanation:
This line will actually throw a Syntax Error because when using const, you must initialize the variable at the time of declaration. In JavaScript, const requires that the variable be assigned a value immediately.

# Correction:
You can either provide an initializer or use let or var if you don't want to initialize it immediately:

const b = 10; // Correctly initializes 'b'

// or if you don't want to initialize it, use let or var
let c; // Valid, but 'c' is undefined


# Final Notes
Syntax Errors prevent the code from executing because the JavaScript engine cannot understand it due to incorrect formatting or rules.
Type Errors occur during execution when the code tries to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type, but in your example, we primarily encountered syntax issues.


## ReferenceError
console.log(t); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 't' before initialization
let t = 10;
# Explanation
This will throw a Reference Error because of the way JavaScript handles variable declarations with let and const.

# Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): When you declare a variable with let (or const), it is not initialized until the line where it is declared. This means that you cannot access it before that line, even though the declaration exists in the code. This period where the variable exists but is not yet initialized is known as the Temporal Dead Zone.

# Error Message: The error message "Cannot access 't' before initialization" indicates that you are trying to access the variable t before it has been initialized.

# Correcting the Error
To fix the Reference Error, you need to ensure that you log t after it has been declared and initialized:


let t = 10;  // Declare and initialize t
console.log(t); // Now this works: Outputs 10

## Summary
# Syntax Errors prevent the code from executing because the JavaScript engine cannot understand it due to incorrect formatting or rules.

# Type Errors occur during execution when the code tries to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type, but in your example, we primarily encountered syntax issues.
# Reference Error occurs when you try to access a variable that hasn't been initialized yet.
