# In JavaScript, a block is a group of statements enclosed in curly braces {}. It allows you to execute multiple statements as a single unit. Blocks are commonly used in control structures such as if, for, while, and functions.

## Example of a Block:

if (condition) {
    // This is a block of code
    statement1;
    statement2;
    statement3;
}

# Purpose of a Block:
Grouping Statements: It allows you to group multiple statements together, which is particularly useful in conditional and looping constructs.

Scope Control: Blocks create a new scope. Variables declared within a block using let or const are not accessible outside of that block.

# Example of Scope Control:
{
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
}
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined

# Conclusion:
Blocks are essential for structuring code in JavaScript, allowing for better organization and scope management.
