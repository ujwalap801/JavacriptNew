## In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive data type and a special value automatically assigned to variables when they are declared but not yet initialized. It represents the absence of a defined value or the fact that a variable hasn't been assigned any value yet.

# Key Characteristics of undefined:
Default Value for Uninitialized Variables:
When you declare a variable without assigning it a value, JavaScript automatically assigns it the value undefined.

let a;
console.log(a);  // Output: undefined


JavaScript is considered a loosely typed or weakly typed language. These terms are used to describe languages where variables are not bound to a specific data type, allowing flexibility in how values are assigned and used.

## What Does "Loosely Typed" or "Weakly Typed" Mean?
Loosely typed means that JavaScript does not enforce strict typing rules. A variable can hold any data type, and its type can change during the execution of the program.
Weakly typed refers to how JavaScript allows implicit conversions between different data types, often referred to as "type coercion." This means that the language automatically tries to convert one data type to another when necessary.
