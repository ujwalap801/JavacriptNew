## JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, enabling developers to build web pages that respond to user actions. Key characteristics of JavaScript include:

## Interpreted Language: JavaScript code is executed line-by-line by the browser's JavaScript engine. 

## Event-Driven: JavaScript can respond to user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements. 

## Versatile: It can be used for both client-side (in the browser) and server-side (with Node.js) scripting. 

## Object-Oriented: Supports object-oriented programming principles.

## Prototypal Inheritance: Unlike classical inheritance, JavaScript uses prototypes to share properties and methods between objects. 

## JavaScript is widely used for web development to enhance user experience, validate forms, create animations, handle asynchronous operations (such as fetching data from a server), and build single-page applications (SPAs) with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
