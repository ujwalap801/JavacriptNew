## In JavaScript, first-class functions are functions that are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions in JavaScript can be:

## Assigned to variables:
### You can assign a function to a variable and treat it like any other value.

## Passed as arguments: 
### Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

##  Returned from other functions: 
### A function can return another function.

## Stored in data structures:
### Functions can be stored in arrays, objects, or any other data structure.
