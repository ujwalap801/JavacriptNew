## In JavaScript (and other programming languages like Python), a closure is a function that remembers and can access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. This ability to retain access to the outer scope's variables, even when the outer function has returned, is what makes closures powerful.


# A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

# Key Concepts:
Inner Function: The function inside another function is called the inner function.
Outer Function: The function that contains the inner function is called the outer function.
Lexical Scope: JavaScript uses lexical scoping, which means the inner function has access to the variables in the outer function's scope at the time it was created.

## Example:

function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = 'Hello';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Inner function can access outerVariable
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunc = outerFunction(); // Returns the innerFunction
closureFunc(); // Logs "Hello"

## Explanation:
outerFunction defines a variable outerVariable and an innerFunction that logs outerVariable.

outerFunction returns innerFunction, so when we call outerFunction(), the returned function is stored in closureFunc.

When closureFunc() is called, it still has access to outerVariable even though outerFunction has already finished executing. This is because the inner function forms a closure over the outer function's variables, preserving them.



## First Snippet

function x() {
    var a = 7;  // Variable a is initialized to 7
    function y() {
        console.log(a);  // Function y logs the value of a
    }
    a = 100;  // a is updated to 100
    return y;  // Returns the function y
}

var z = x();  // Call x() and assign the returned function y to z
console.log(z);  
// Output:
// y()
// {
//     console.log(a);
// }

z();  // Call the function stored in z
// Output: 7

## Explanation of the First Snippet
Function x(): Inside this function, a is initially set to 7.

Inner Function y(): This function logs the value of a.

Updating a: Before y() is returned, a is updated to 100.

Returning y(): When x() is called, it returns the function y(), which now forms a closure over the variable a.

Assigning to z: The returned function y() is assigned to z. At this point, a has been updated to 100, but it hasn't been logged yet.

Logging z: When console.log(z) is executed, it prints the function definition of y(), not the value of a.

Calling z(): When z() is called, it logs 7 instead of 100 because the closure captured the value of a when y() was defined, which was still 7 at that moment, before it was updated.


## Second Snippet
function z() {
    var b = 100;  // Variable b is initialized to 100
    function x() {
        var a = 7;  // Variable a is initialized to 7
        function y() {  
            console.log(a, b);  // Logs the values of a and b
        }
        y();  // Call the function y
    }
    x();  // Call the function x
}

z();  // Call the outer function z

# Explanation of the Second Snippet
Function z(): Inside this function, b is initialized to 100.

Inner Function x(): Inside x(), a is initialized to 7.

Inner Function y(): This function logs the values of a and b.

Calling y(): Immediately after defining y(), it is called. It logs 7 (from x()) and 100 (from z()) because y() has access to both a and b.

Calling x(): When z() is called, it in turn calls x(), which then calls y(), leading to the output of 7 100.

## Third Snippet (Similar to the First)

function x() {
    var a = 7;  // Variable a is initialized to 7
    function y() {
        console.log(a);  // Function y logs the value of a
    }
    a = 100;  // a is updated to 100
    return y;  // Returns the function y
}

var z = x();  // Call x() and assign the returned function y to z
console.log(z);  
// Output:
// y()
// {
//     console.log(a);
// }

z();  // Call the function stored in z
// Output: 100

## Explanation of the Third Snippet
This snippet is similar to the first one but highlights a key point:

The same function x() is defined.

a is initially set to 7, then updated to 100.

The closure retains the reference to a, but the variable a has been updated to 100 before returning y().

When you call z(), which refers to y(), it now logs 100 because y() accesses the current value of a, which was last set to 100.
