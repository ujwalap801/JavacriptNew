## 1. Function Using let

function x() {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log(i);
        }, i * 1000);
    }

    console.log("Hi");
}
x();

# Explanation:
let i: The loop variable i is declared with let, which means it has block scope. Each iteration of the loop creates a new binding for i.
setTimeout: Inside the setTimeout, the value of i is captured at the time the setTimeout function is executed, which is determined by the loop's iteration.

# Execution Flow:
The loop runs from 1 to 5, scheduling a timeout for each value of i (1 second, 2 seconds, etc.).
After the loop completes, "Hi" is logged immediately.

# Output:
After 1 second: 1
After 2 seconds: 2
After 3 seconds: 3
After 4 seconds: 4
After 5 seconds: 5
Then "Hi" is printed immediately.
Final Output:

# Copy code
Hi
1
2
3
4
5


## 2. Function Using var

function x() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        function close(x) {
            setTimeout(function() {
                console.log(x);
            }, x * 1000);
        }
        close(i);
    }
    console.log("Hi");
}
x();


# Explanation:
var i: The loop variable i is declared with var, which means it has function scope. There is only one i shared across all iterations.
Function close(x): This function is called with the current value of i on each iteration, and it captures x correctly.

# Execution Flow:
Each call to close(i) schedules a setTimeout for the current value of i. Even though i is shared, the value passed to close is used directly within the setTimeout callback.

After the loop completes, "Hi" is logged immediately.
# Output:
After 1 second: 1
After 2 seconds: 2
After 3 seconds: 3
After 4 seconds: 4
After 5 seconds: 5
Then "Hi" is printed immediately.


# Final Output:
Hi
1
2
3
4
5

## Summary of Behavior
Using let:

Each iteration of the loop has its own i, allowing each setTimeout to print the correct value after the specified delay.
Using var with a closure:

Although var creates a single shared i, the value of x is passed to setTimeout, allowing it to log the correct values as well.
