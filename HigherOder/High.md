## A function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function


## Follow DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle while coding.


## A higher-order function in JavaScript (and other programming languages) is a function that meets one of the following criteria:

### It takes one or more functions as arguments.
### It returns a function as its result.


# Higher-order functions are powerful tools in functional programming, enabling abstraction and code reuse. They allow for more concise and expressive code by treating functions as first-class citizens.



# Summary
### Higher-order functions enable more modular, reusable, and expressive code. They allow you to encapsulate behavior, pass around functions, and apply operations to data in a functional programming style.



## Higher-order function that takes a callback and a value
