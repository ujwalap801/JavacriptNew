# Shadowing in JavaScript occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (like a function or block) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. When this happens, the inner variable "shadows" or hides the outer variable, making the outer variable inaccessible from the inner scope.

Hereâ€™s how shadowing works for the three types of variable declarations: var, let, and const.

## 1. Using var
Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally-scoped, and they can be re-declared and updated. However, shadowing can occur within functions or blocks:

var x = 10; // outer scope

function example() {
    var x = 20; // inner scope (shadows outer x)
    console.log(x); // 20
}

example();
console.log(x); // 10


## 2. Using let
Variables declared with let are block-scoped and cannot be re-declared in the same scope. Shadowing can still occur, but the inner variable remains confined to its block:

let x = 10; // outer scope

if (true) {
    let x = 20; // inner scope (shadows outer x)
    console.log(x); // 20
}

console.log(x); // 10

## 3. Using const
Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped and cannot be re-declared in the same scope. They must also be initialized at the time of declaration. Shadowing works similarly:

const x = 10; // outer scope

if (true) {
    const x = 20; // inner scope (shadows outer x)
    console.log(x); // 20
}

console.log(x); // 10

## Summary
var: Function or global scope, can be re-declared and updated; allows shadowing.
let: Block scope, cannot be re-declared in the same scope; allows shadowing.
const: Block scope, must be initialized at declaration, cannot be re-declared or updated; allows shadowing.
