### A lexical environment is a structure that holds the variables and functions of a certain scope. Each function in JavaScript creates its own lexical environment.


### It consists of two parts:

### Local Memory: Where the variables and functions defined within that environment are stored.

### Reference to the Parent Lexical Environment: Allows access to variables in outer scopes



### Every function creates a new lexical environment.
### Functions can access variables from their own scope as well as from the parent scope due to lexical scoping.
