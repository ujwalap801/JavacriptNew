JavaScript is both synchronous and asynchronous, but at its core, it is single-threaded and synchronous. Let's clarify this further:

1. Synchronous Nature:
By default, JavaScript executes code synchronously, meaning one line of code is executed at a time, in a top-to-bottom order. It does not move to the next line until the current one has finished executing.

console.log('First');
console.log('Second');
console.log('Third');


output:
First
Second
Third

2. Asynchronous Behavior:
While JavaScript is inherently synchronous, it has the ability to handle asynchronous operations, such as:

API calls (AJAX/fetch requests)
Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
Event listeners
Promises
Async/await
These asynchronous features allow JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. They rely on a combination of the event loop, callback queue, and promises to manage asynchronous tasks, so other code can continue to execute without waiting for these tasks to complete.


console.log('First');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Second (asynchronous)');
}, 2000);

console.log('Third');


output:
First
Third
Second (asynchronous)  // This will be printed after a delay of 2 seconds
