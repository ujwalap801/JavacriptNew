conditional statements
Iterative statements

The main difference between a for loop and a while loop is that a for loop is used when the number of repetitions is known, while a while loop is used when the number of repetitions is unknown

a "do-while loop" ensures that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition, making it ideal for scenarios where you want to perform an action immediately and then decide if further iterations are needed based on a condition.
