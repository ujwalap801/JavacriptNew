# In JavaScript, let and var are used for variable declarations, but they behave differently in terms of scope and hoisting. Here's an explanation of each:


**Scope** refers to the context in which variables and functions can be accessed in your code.


## 1. `var`

### Scope

- `var` is **function-scoped**, meaning it is limited to the function in which it is declared. If declared outside any function, it becomes **globally scoped**.
- It **ignores block scope** (like in loops or if-else blocks) and can be accessed outside the block in which it was declared.


### Example


### if (true) {
### var x = 10; // x is declared inside an if block
### }
### console.log(x); // Outputs: 10, because var is not block-scoped


### Hoisting
### Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope. However, their value is undefined until they are initialized.


### Example

### console.log(a); // Outputs: undefined, because a is hoisted
### var a = 5;


## 2. `let`
### Scope

### let is block-scoped, meaning it is only available within the block (delimited by {}) where it is declared, such as in loops or if statements.

### Example

### if (true) {
### let y = 20; // y is declared inside an if block
### }
### console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined, because let is block-scoped


### Hoisting
### Like var, let declarations are hoisted. However, let variables are not initialized during hoisting, and accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.


### Example
### console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is in the temporal dead zone
### let b = 10;



## Global Scope

### Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the code. They are not confined to any function or block.

### Example
### let globalVar = "I am a global variable";

### function displayGlobalVar() {
  ### console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
### }

### displayGlobalVar(); // Outputs: I am a global variable
### console.log(globalVar); // Outputs: I am a global variable


## Function Scope

### Variables declared within a function are accessible only within that function. They are not available outside of it.


## Example
### function myFunction() {
  ### var localVar = "I am a local variable";
  ### console.log(localVar); // Outputs: I am a local variable
### }

### myFunction();
### console.log(localVar); // ReferenceError: localVar is not defined



## Block Scope

### Variables declared using let and const within a block (delimited by {}) are confined to that block. They cannot be accessed outside of it.


### Example
### if (true) {
### let blockVar = "I am a block-scoped variable";
  ### console.log(blockVar); // Outputs: I am a block-scoped variable
### }

### console.log(blockVar); // ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
